# blog.elijah.run

This site contains my primary blog and personal site.
It can be accessed on a few domains:

* https://elijah.run
* https://elijahcaine.me (legacy)

## Developing

I use NixOS for devleopment, but you don't have to!
You just need the following programs installed:

* zola
* make

Then run the following to run the website locally:

```
make dev
```

This will build a local copy of the website you can view at a URL printed by the command, usually http://localhost:1111/ or something like that.
