## All Packed

So I'm all packed up and ready to go.

![Three weeks of supplies neatly displayed on a pink bed](/assets/images/europe-2015/packed.jpg)

**Left:** Chargers, electronics, entertainment, toiletries, water bottle, wallet, etc.

**Center:** The bag, the *Write the Docs* shirt I'll be wearing.

**Right:** Clothing. Gameboy SP at the top.

Not the *perfect* bag of things to bring to Europe, but certainly solid and most of it practical.
I'm packing an extra bag for all of the trinkets I'll bring back.

Let me know if you want anything (if you know how to contact me we're close enough for you to ask.)
