## PDX -\> AMS

The flight was uneventful.
It was the longest one I've ever been on, which is always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the
better flights I've taken.
TIL Delta's service does not suck.

I usually sleep the entire way to \<insert location here\>, but I managed to stay productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight.
I must say, it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I've wanted to watch that show for ages...

\[*Lazy bliss not pictured*\]

So good.

## Day 0: Part 1

So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far:

- People keep using fake made up words. What's up with that?
- The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them.
  It looks like chaos but I haven't seen an accident yet.
  I'm kinda impressed.
  People aren't even yelling at each other about almost getting hit.
- The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles.
  It might just be the toilet paper at the place I am staying.
  Either way, I can't deal with this aspect ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam.
- **COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE**
- The trains are so quiet.
  I didn't want to get off...
- **BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES**

Here's some pictures I took:

Aaaaaaaand naptime.

## Day 0: Part 2

I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There were a lot of half naked ladies in windows.
They kept winking at me. I'm pretty sure they liked me; it's not like they *definitely* have a monetary incentive to get my attention or anything.

I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer.
It tasted [surprisingly good](https://xkcd.com/1534/)

*So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.*
