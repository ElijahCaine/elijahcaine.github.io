## The Rijks Museum

*I'm not sure which street I took this panorama on, but I think it looks awesome.*
*It captures the Amsterdam canal street pretty well.*

Today I went to the Rijks Museum and had a bit of a culture overload.

Everybody got selfies with Van Gough, so I got a selfie The Milkmaid.
I realize in retrospect that it doesn't work as well.

In other news, this is my face when I realized the bathroom stalls go from floor to ceiling.

*Yes, this photo was taken in the bathroom stall.*

And this is a classy restaurant I found with classy lamps.

*They were closed, otherwise I would have gone in.*

## Some Travel Tips

Although I have not completed my trip, I have some tips to share with you about travel.

- Always bring a 'Go Bag' when you go out for the day.
  Fill it with snacks and necessities and leave plenty of room for memorabilia you get while out and about.
- Try something new before defaulting to your comfort zone.
  This is true for food as well as experiences.
- Always being plenty of snacks and water.
  You will regret it if you don't.
- Be patient.
  You invested a lot to get here, make it count.
- At a museum, take a picture of the plackard after taking a picture of the piece so you don't forget what it's called.
- Don't be afraid to sit in a caf√© and just read for a bit.
  Sometimes that's as culturally diversifying as a day in a museum or city tour.
