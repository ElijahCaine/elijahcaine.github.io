I went on a wonderful [city tour](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/eu/2015/#events) of Prague provided by Write The Docs.
We crossed some bridges, saw some castles, and experienced many wonderful parts of the city.

*Here's me in front of a church eating some gelato.*

After the tour I was very hungry and tagged along with some folks from my tour group on a journey to get food.
We went to a restaurant that brought us beer on a model train.

![Choo choo. Here comes the beer train.](/images/europe-2015/prague-beer-train.jpg)

*This is the train that brought us beer.*

Here are some picture I took of the buildings in the city.
I like the architecture a lot.

*They are so cool.*
*I haven't found the words to describe why, but the asthetics please me.*

After the tour and food there was a *Write the Docs Conference Reception* (aka meet & greet) where I got to hang out with many of the attendees of the conference.
There was food and fabulous people.

I did not have a hard time falling asleep that night.
