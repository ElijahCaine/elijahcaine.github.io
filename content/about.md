## Work

The site moved recently, so I am still filling this out.

## Talks

You can find slides for all my talks at [slides.elijahcaine.me](http://slides.elijahcaine.me)

I've spoken at some conferences including:

- SeAGL (2016): *An introduction to git*
- Beaver Barcamp (Unconference 2015,2017): *Various topics*
- Cat Barcamp (Unconference 2017): *A practical introduction to Kubernetes*

## School

I graduated from *Oregon State University* with a four(ish)-year degree in *Computer Science*, a focus toward *Cryptography*, and a minor in *Mathematics* on December of 2017.

## Play

For about 3 years I ran and mentored the Oregon State University Linux Users Group ([osulug](http://lug.oregonstate.edu/)).
We hosted:

- *Industry Professionals* like CoreOS and Nordstrom engineers to speak with students about internships and
- *Student Talks* where club members gave talks on Raspberry Pi projects, software projects, Thesis Defense practice.
- *Install Festivals* where we helped people install Linux.
- *Coding Puzzles* where we are challenged to finish coding puzzles and rewarded for completing the most.
- *Game Hackathon* where we teamed up to complete a small working game in under an hour.
- *Languages Night* where we had a round-table to talk about software development.

The LUG stayed busy.
