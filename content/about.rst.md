## School

I graduated from *Oregon State University* with a four(ish)-year degree
in *Computer Science*, a focus toward *Cryptography*, and a minor in
*Mathematics* on December of 2017.

## Play

For about 3 years I ran and mentored the Oregon State University Linux
Users Group ([osulug](http://lug.oregonstate.edu/)). We hosted

- *Industry Professionals* like CoreOS and Nordstrom engineers to speak
  with students about internships and
- *Student Talks* where club members gave talks on Raspberry Pi
  projects, software projects, Thesis Defense practice.
- *Install Festivals* where we helped people install Linux.
- *Coding Puzzles* where we are challenged to finish coding puzzles and
  rewarded for completing the most.
- *Game Hackathon* where we teamed up to complete a small working game
  in under an hour.
- *Languages Night* where we had a round-table to talk about software
  development.

The LUG stayed busy.
