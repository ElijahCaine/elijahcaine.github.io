This weekend I went to [Cat Barcamp 2015](http://catbarcamp.org/), an
unconference run by the PSU [Computer Action Team](http://cat.pdx.edu/).
I went to some awesome talks (and gave one myself).

I enjoyed every talk I went to. Here they are in order:

1.  **History of Cryptography.**
    This was given by one of my OSL co-workers. It didn't contain a ton
    of new information for me, but was delivered very well and focused
    on different types of cryptography and the context in which each one
    was developed. I enjoyed it.

2.  **Haskell on Steroids.**
    I kinda checked out during this talk because I wanted to write my
    slides... Wooops. It looked very interesting and mathey though...

3.  **Introduction to Test Driven Development in Power Shell.**
    Whoa Windows! (actually though, I learned more about Power Shell
    than I ever expected to know).

4.  **MY TALK.**
    [(see below)](#my-talk)

5.  **A Whirlwind Tour of Lojban.**
    Lojban seems like a cool language. Corbin (previous LUG president)
    gave this talk, he's a cool guy... you might even say he's
    TheMostAwesomeDude.

6.  **Adventures in IT Security: Then and now.**
    I like history. I also like computers. This was a good talk. I am
    biased.

7.  **Talking to people! (or, How I learned to stop worrying and love the user.)**
    Spoiler: The secret is understanding social cues.

## My Talk

I decided on the spur of the moment to give a talk 'How to Write a (very
mediocre) Static Site Generator' and with only 40 minutes of prep work I
was able to fill an hour pretty well.

Here are some links from that:

- The [demo
  code](https://gist.github.com/ElijahCaine/0ee1ef21692f3cbb6934).
- The [abomination of a
  website](http://elijahcaine.me/catbarcamp2015-demo/) we built between
  the demo and the end of the session (epilepsy warning... no
  seriously).
- The [very sparse
  slides](http://slides.elijahcaine.me/cat-barcamp-2015_how-to-an-ssg/).

## TLDR

The CAT is an awesome group of people. I'm glad I was able to get a few
LUG members to come to the event. If I went to PSU I would be honored to
work with the CAT. They throw a hellofan event.
