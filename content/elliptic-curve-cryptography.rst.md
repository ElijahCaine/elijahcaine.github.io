This post is jumps around a bit. We'll start by showing how Elliptic
Curve Cryptography works at a high level, then create a list of
questions about how/why Elliptic Curve Cryptography works and how it is
useful to cryptogrpahy. Once those questions are answered we will end
with a recap. Hopefully we will zero in on what Elliptic Curves are and
what Elliptic Curve Cryptography is.

## Diffie-Hellman key exchange ++

You find yourself day-dreaming during a walk around campus wondering if
there is an alternative cryptography system to the very popular RSA. You
want something that has improved computational and network efficiency.
You want smaller keys that are harder to crack. Could such a system
exist?

You share this fantasy with a friend, you share all of your crypto
fantasies with this friend, and they tell you that Elliptic Curve
Cryptography is promising and it perfectly fits your needs. ... but how
does it work?

### Diffie-Hellman key exchange (a recap)

To create a useful crypto out of Elliptic Curves we need to implement
[Diffie–Hellman key
exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange)
(DHKE). Once we have DHKE we more or less have a valid crypto system
which we can build upon to encrypt and decrypt private information.

The reader (you) is assumed to be familiar with DHKE. While DHKE is
fairly simple, it is not unforgettable, so here is quick reminder:

1.  Alice and Bob agree on a public modulus (p) and a base (g).
2.  Alice and Bob both choose secret integers (a and b).
3.  Alice sends Bob g<sup>a</sup> (mod p) (we call it A) and Bob sends
    Alice g<sup>b</sup> (mod p) (we call it B).
4.  Alice computes B<sup>a</sup> (mod p) and Bob computes A<sup>b</sup>
    (mod p). These are equivalent (mod p). This is Alice and Bob's
    shared secret.

How do we use Elliptic Curves get a similar 'shared secret'?

### Elliptic Diffie-Hellman key exchange

At a (very) high level the algorithm is as follows:

1.  Alice and Bob agree to use a given Elliptic Curve over a finite
    field, E(F<sub>p</sub>), and a public point P ∈ E(F<sub>p</sub>).
2.  Alice chooses a secret integer n<sub>A</sub> and Bob choose secret
    integers n<sub>B</sub>.
3.  Alice computes Q<sub>A</sub> = n<sub>A</sub>P and Bob computes
    Q<sub>B</sub> = n<sub>B</sub>P. These are the "Public Keys"
4.  Alice sends Bob her public key, Bob send Alice his public key.
5.  Alice computes n<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub>, Bob computes
    n<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>.
6.  The shared secret value is n<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub> =
    n<sub>A</sub>(n<sub>B</sub>P) = n<sub>B</sub>(n<sub>A</sub>P) =
    n<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>A</sub>

It looks similar to the given DHKE algorithm, and seems promising,
but... how does it work?

## Elliptic Curves and Elliptic Curve Cryptography Q&A

To answer that we are going to answer the following:

- What are Elliptic Curves?
- What does an Elliptic Curve look like?
- What does it mean to multiply P by n?
- What about a finite field?
- How are the pubic keys used? Why are these a shared secret?
- Why is Elliptic Curve Cryptography useful?

### What are Elliptic Curves?

A Elliptic Curve is the set of solutions to an equation of the form

> y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + AX + B

### What does an Elliptic Curve look like?

Two examples of Elliptic Curves are as follows:

and:

class="align-center" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Another simple Elliptic Curve" />

### Adding P and Q

Multiplication is *just* repeated addition. Oh shoot we haven't said how
"addition" happens on an Elliptic Curve. Let's do that.

Addition is the process of drawing a line L between P and Q. The third
point that the line L intersects is point R. When R is reflected over
the X axis we call this R'. The result of P ⊕ Q (read: P 'plus' Q) is
R'.

We can enumerate these steps as:

1.  Take two points P and Q on the Elliptic Curve E.
2.  Draw a line L which passes through these two points.
3.  L should ultimately pass through *three* points: P, Q, and R.
4.  Multiply the Y coordinate of R by -1, this is R'.
5.  P ⊕ Q = R'.

Here's a visualization of straight forward addition.

<img src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-3.png"
class="align-center" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Annotated curve E with points P, Q, R, R&#39; and line L labeled." />

You might think "What happens when P is tangent a point on E?" In that
case we say P = Q, so R = P ⊕ P, or R = 2P. It looks like this:

<img src="/assets/images/independent-crypto/ecc-4.png"
class="align-center" style="width:100.0%"
alt="Annotated curve E with points P, R, R&#39; and line L labeled. P is tangent to the curve." />

Wait a second, 2P looks like n\*P which was one of the questions we had!
Don't worry, we'll get there soon.

### That thing about Finite Fields

In practice we bound the curve over a field F<sub>p</sub> with p ≥ 3. We
input {1, 2, ..., p-1} as the value of X in E and select the results
which are squares modulo 13.

For example:

> E : y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 3X + 8 over F<sub>13</sub>
> X = 1
> 1 + 3 + 8 = 12
> 12 is a square (mod 13)

Repeating this gives us the set of points in E(F<sub>13</sub>):

> E(F<sub>13</sub>) = {O, (1,5), (1,8), (2,3), (2,10), (9,6), (9,7),
> (12,2), (12,11)}

In practice this bounds the graph of E and forces us to draw a strange
modulus graph shown below:

curve cryptography*[^1]

### Multiplying P by an integer with The Double-and-Add Algorithm

To "multiply" P by n we need to use the Double-and-Add Algorithm. Here's
how that looks:

0.  Take a point P ∈ E(F<sub>p</sub>) and an integer n ≥ 1.
1.  Set Q = P and R = O.
2.  Loop while n \> 0.
    3.  If n ≡ 1 (mod 2), set R = R + Q
    4.  Set Q = 2Q and n = floor(n/2).
3.  Return the point R, which equals nP.

*Recall that the algorithm for finding point 2Q was covered in the above
section* [Adding P and Q](#adding-p-and-q)

### What *is* the shared secret?

Let's review. The shared secret is the second point
n<sub>A</sub>n<sub>B</sub>P, which is a point on the public curve
E(F<sub>p</sub>). This point can be used to encrypt information as it is
a shared secret (necessary for DHKE). How exactly it is used to encrypt
information is left as an exercise for readers in charge of
cryptographic implementation standards.

The reason this is a shared secret is because an adversary needs to
solve the following Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem

> nP = Q<sub>A</sub>

Which is a very hard problem, as mentioned in the next section.

## An example of Elliptic Curve Cryptography

This sounds good in theory, but let's give it a test drive.

Alice and Bob are given the following shared information:

> p = 3851, E: y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + 324X + 1287, P = (920,
> 303) ∈ E(F<sub>3851</sub>)

Alice and Bob choose their secret integers:

> n<sub>A</sub> = 1194
> n<sub>B</sub> = 1759

Alice and Bob then compute their public keys:

> Alice computes Q<sub>A</sub> = 1194P = (2067, 2178) ∈
> E(F<sub>3851</sub>)
> Bob computes Q<sub>B</sub> = 1759P = (3684, 3125) ∈
> E(F<sub>3851</sub>)

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Remember that we use the Double-and-Add algorithm to compute
Q<sub>A</sub> and Q<sub>B</sub>. This invloves iteratively computing the
tangent line at a point, the intersection with E at that intersection,
and reflecting that point over the X axis.

</div>

Alice and Bob trade public keys and calculate their shared secret:

> Alice computes n<sub>A</sub>Q<sub>B</sub> = 1194(3684, 3125) = (3347,
> 1242) ∈ E(F<sub>3851</sub>)
> Bob computes n<sub>B</sub>Q<sub>A</sub> = 1759(2067, 2178) = (3347,
> 1242) ∈ E(F<sub>3851</sub>)

Therefore (3347, 1242) is the shared secret.

## Why Elliptic Curve Cryptography is useful

While it is harder than simply multiplying mod p for Alice to compute
her shared secret (which is the case in RSA), it is *even harder* for a
malicious actor to figure out that same shared secret. This point is
best put by the source *A (relatively easy to understand) primer on
elliptic curve cryptography*[^2]:

So an Elliptic Curve Cryptography key can be one magnitude smaller in
size and offer the same level of security as RSA.

We can put this in more concrete terms: the fastest algorithm to solve
the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem, which Elliptic DHKE
security is built upon, in E(F<sub>p</sub>) takes √p steps. This is much
more difficult than the 'vanilla' Discrete Logarithm Problem.

## Notes and edge cases

Elliptic Curve Cryptography, much like the rest of Cryptography, deals
heavily with [Number
Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory). Despite my best
efforts most of the nitty-gritty Number Theory in this topic went *way*
over my head. As a result I didn't include much of that kind of stuff
and instead focused on the things I *could* share and sound smart about.

Here are some other things about Elliptic Curve Cryptography I didn't
cover that deserve more air time:

- The Elliptic Curve chosen must meet a special set of criteria; any old
  Elliptic Curve won't do. This was the cause of a cryptographic breach
  with Elliptic Curve Cryptography a few years ago that triggered doubts
  about Elliptic Curve Cryptography as a whole.
- Some primes cause solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm
  Problem for E(F<sub>p</sub>) to be easier than the Discrete Logarithm
  Problem, these primes can be computed and should be avoided.
- If you want a deeper understanding of the theory of Elliptic Curves
  (addition of points on these curves, etc) you should look into
  [algebraic
  geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry).

## Annotated Bibliography

An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography[^3]
The chapter in this textbook on Elliptic Curves in Cryptography
established the bedrock understanding of the topic of Elliptic Curve
Cryptography. This ended up being the main resource for this post and
offered a great median between "Regular Joe's guide to Elliptic Curve
Cryptography" and "The graduate student's guide to Elliptic Curve
Cryptography" which were my other two resources. It was also the source
of all examples, which were very useful in gaining an intuitive
understanding of the material.

A (relatively easy to understand) primer on elliptic curve cryptography[^4]
This blog post was my *second* source and did a good job of taking the
proofs and dense material in Intro to Math Cyrpto (above) and boiled it
down to the important stuff. It drastically improved further readings of
the original textbook and provided that great animated image of adding P
⊕ Q in E(F<sub>p</sub>). It didn't cover any of the Number Theory, but
explained the historical context of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, roughly
how/why it works, and did a good job of describing it's impact in our
world today.

Cryptography: An Introduction[^5]
This wasn't a resource I actually *used*, but I did read the chapter on
Elliptic Curve Cryptography (chapter 2!). It gave me an appreciation for
the previous two sources and some exposure to the other ways Elliptic
Curves can be taught.
