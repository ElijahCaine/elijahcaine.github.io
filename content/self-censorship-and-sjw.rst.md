**Authors note from 2024** I don't *disagree* with the thesis of this
piece (something about the internet being overzealous in it's negative
feedback to creators?) but a lot of my claims are over-reaching and
(more importantly) I don't think my voice contributes much to this
converstaion -- then and now. I am leaving it up because I don't feel
that it is problematic, but I do suggest you find a different post to
read because honestly it's not very good.

---

This post is an articulation of *feelings* I have been mulling over
about internet media and culture, a subject I have no academic
qualification to speak on but have strong feelings about. I don't intend
for this to be inflammatory or contrarian but if it helps start a
discussion I'll be happy. My only intention is to contribute to an
important conversation. I appreciate you taking the time to read it and
hope you get something out of it.

## Definition

Wikipedia (I trust it, don't you?) has an entry on self-censorship which
starts:

> Self-censorship is the act of censoring or classifying one's own blog,
> book, film, or other forms of media. This is done out of fear of, or
> deference to, the sensibilities or preferences (actual or perceived)
> of others and without overt pressure from any specific party or
> institution of authority. Self-censorship is often practiced by film
> producers, film directors, publishers, news anchors, journalists,
> musicians, and other kinds of authors including individuals who use
> social media.

You're welcome to look at a few definitions which are more broad
([Cambridge
def](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/self-censorship),
[Oxford
def](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/self-censorship)).
I actually like using the Wikipedia entry, so I'll be using it in this
piece.

There are a few highlights of the Wiki entry that I want to point out:

- Self-censorship can be caused by real or perceived sensibilities.
- It is done out of fear or deference (submission/respect for others
  wishes).
- It is mostly a voluntary action practiced by creators.
- It is practiced by individuals producing everything from "big media"
  to social media.

I like these four points because they set up a conflict I want to
explore: the Creator versus the Consumer.

## Consumer

The consumer watches, reads, or listens to something and when they find
a discrepancy which does not fit their mental model for what *that
media* should do, they have the option to point it out.

- "This character is a crude portrayal of bi-sexuality."
- "This line was offensive to the elderly."
- "This scene triggered me because I was almost killed in a car
  accident."

The consumer points it out directly with the creator, to the creator
publicly, or to the public and not directly with the creator at all.
This archetype is almost always acting in the interest of a racial,
gendered, sexual, or social minority and often they do so *on behalf* of
minorities which they themselves are not apart of.

As a feminist I agree with the consumer’s intentions and with each
individual consumer who voice their concerns. Just like a writer doesn't
improve without feedback so to a content creator cannot mindfully make
more respectful work without being made aware of the mistakes they have
made. Each individual consumer, with exceptions of course, is a good
person doing the right thing.

## Creator

The creator wants to share an idea with the world. They have the burning
urge to write, blog, podcast, televise, film, tweet, tumblr, paint,
compose, etc. Their intentions are also (usually) good. This archetype
wants to create something great and share it with the world, or at the
very least some sub-culture they identify with.

When the creator *creates something* they inevitably put a part of
themselves into *that thing*. When a consumer points out what *that
something* should have done differently they are often a small voice in
a hurricane of feedback. This hurricane is often filled with positive
feedback but the silent majority that appreciate something often say
nothing while the loud minority openly share their thoughts and
criticisms. Those who speak up are also known to forget that a human
being is going to read what they just hit **send** on. Even if the
feedback is ultimately constructive the content creator is known to only
see the bad and fight to see the good. As a result of this personal
shit-storm for the creator, continuing to create becomes a fight against
both the creativity but also against their fans who care enough to *give
them that feedback*, but deliver it in a hurtful or stressful way. There
have been many stories in which a content creator who wanted to put
themselves out there was forced to pull back because of circumstances
like these.

This is best explained with an example, so here is an expert from an
article on The A.V. Club:

In this instance the writer of a very progressive kids show (which I
proudly watch with my other adult friends) was ridiculed for... what?
Not being perfect? Not flawlessly pushing every equality agenda at once?
Ultimately it may have been held to a *higher standard* but to what end?

Modern creators are being pushed and prodded by tens to hundreds to
thousands of tiny voices saying "This isn't right, do this better." As a
result both new and experienced creators feel a pressure to craft
something which is *perfect* and *devoid of that which can be critiqued
and judged*. A whole generation of writers, directors, and story tellers
are afraid to say *anything* because it *might* be panned for it's
imperfections and/or perceived agenda. The unfortunate part is that many
forget that your work *will* be critiqued no matter what you say. In
twenty years we'll be looking back at 2016 and be flabbergasted by our
ignorance about... I don't know --laugh tracks. The point being that we
are not perfect creatures and so too our creators are imperfect. We
collectively acknowledge that, yet the creator is punished harshly when
they make a mistake, receiving a punishment which does not match the
crime.

## Conclusion

The main takeaway from all of this is that we should try to be mindful
of the creator's imperfections when pointing them out. Time and time
again the mass of the internet is able to devastate the creators we have
and scare the creator's we don't. We all say stupid things that we don't
remember are offensive or haven't yet been informed is offensive;
whether somebody said an offensive thing to an audience of millions or
an audience of one we shouldn't criticize them just because we can. A
friend of mine put it pretty well when he said '*On this road to social
justice we're not all on the same page, let's cut them some slack.*'

I understand that I am saying this to nobody in particular. The
problems, fear, and *weight of the internet* are not something I have
*experience* in; they are a concern all the same. I am not well known
and I have not *created* nor been thrown into any *shit-storms* I talk
about. Those close to me have experienced this trauma and they warn
others like an oracle warns adventurers not to go into the dark forest.
I understand that self-censorship is not a new problem by any means, but
since the *dawn of time* there have been individuals scared of change
for completely rational reasons.

Be mindful of what you say and what you do not say on the internet. As a
fan you have more influence than you think over the media you love.
Everything is created by people *just like you*. Before you say
something negative remember that *a person will read it*, so meditate on
it before hitting *send*. Imagine reading it in the sea of everything
else that person is dealing with. Individuals should hold each other
responsible but that doesn't mean you need to *hurt* them because they
*offended* you. I wont advise you on when or how to act because that is
your responsibility. If you find something truly offensive of course you
should tell the person who made it, but also remember that you are in a
unique position to be judge, jury, **and** executioner, even if it is
only on a small scale. Having this power, meter your response to match
the crime and *think* before you *act*.

We are all people. We all want to do the right thing. I don't mean to
discourage consumers from voicing their concerns, just to avoid
*punishing* creators for imperfection. In the world there is no good and
bad only people making the best of their situation with positive
intentions.
