# So. Much. Batman.

This month a friend of mine shared that they weren't really into comics _except for Batman_.
I have been reading a _lot_ of comics recently (I'll write a post about my backlog journey sometime) and I realized I have _never read a batman comic_.
No joke, just never picked one up.
I've played games, watched movies, but never engaged with the source material.

This month I changed that.
Let's get into it.

## Batman: Year One

As the title suggests, this is the _classic_ origin Batman origin story.
Great place to start if you want to get into Batman.

## Batman: The Long Halloween

This was a _perfect_ follow-up to Year One.
It reads more like a noir story and less like a super-hero comic, which I liked.

Also the cape _is a character_.
Not in the literal sense, but visually it is striking.

## Batman: The White Knight

This is more current era compared to the Year One and Long Halloween.
It served as an interesting introduction for me to The Joker and Harley Quinn(s).

# Toontown Rewritten

Besides Batman I got into a little MMO called [Toontown Rewritten](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/).

> Yes. [_That_ Toontown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toontown_Online). The one from the early 2000's.

Toontown Rewritten is _amazing_.
I have no idea _how_ it got made, but it's an entirely community made, free to play, micro-transaction-free MMO in the year of our lord 2024.
**HOW**??

It is fun, free, and a whimsical experience.
You should check it out!
