# "Friend's Art" House Show

{{ image(path="whats-good-2024-12/lucy-art.jpg", width=500, alt="Photography by Lucy") }}

My wonderful wife Lucy had the _genius_ idea of inviting our friends to show their artwork at our home!
None of our friends are _professional_ artists, at least not in the medium they were showing, which made the event really fun!

We had a great showing too!
Folks shared a variety of ARTifacts:

* Photography from a class taken years ago
* Sketches from a class taken recently
* Stamps they just got into making (all fall-themed)
* A poem made for the event
* A piano cover many months in the works
* I used the deadline to light a fire under my ass to [make a small game](@/set-game.md)

It was really nice that everybody was able to share a piece of themselves that doesn't come up often and which is usually (at best) just hanging up at their home.
It was an open invitation to share a part of yourself you have put time and effort into, but don't usually feel  you can brag or show off without it being an "all-eyes-on-me-big-deal" thing.

If this sounds fun you should try it!

1. Invite your friends to submit art
2. Collect the art a few days before the event
3. Install the art in your home; hang on walls, etc.
4. Acquire charcuterie and wine (make it feel like a fancy art opening)
5. Enjoy!

# Ubik

{{ image(path="whats-good-2024-12/ubik.png", width=200, alt="Ubik") }}

[Ubik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubik) is a novel by Philip K. Dick which somehow I had _never_ heard of but I _absolutely loved_.

The premise is that in the far future of... (*checks notes*) **1992** we have flying cars, regular trips to Moon colonies, and micro-transactions in real life.
We also have a way to extend life in a half-living state called Half Life (no relation to physics or the video game), and people with mental powers like mind reading and predicting the future exist -- also people who can cancel those powers out.

The premise is fun and includes a bunch of themes I really like including time-travel-adjacent plots and a dubiously trustworthy narrator.

> Ubik was a recommendation from a friend who lent me the book which I really appreciated! It was nice to talk about the book and the next day start reading (as opposed to waiting for the library copy that was a few weeks out).

# In the Miso Soup

{{ image(path="whats-good-2024-12/in-the-miso-soup.png", width=200, alt="In the Miso Soup") }}

[In the Miso Soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Miso_Soup) is a psychological horror novel by Ryu Murakami which I really enjoyed!
The way the novel builds tension, then releases it, and then uhh... has an entire third part was very exciting!
I don't read a lot of horror but this made me want to get into the genre.

> This book was reading for a podcast I follow called [Something Rotten](https://nebula.tv/somethingrotten).
  Usually the hosts talk about Video Games, but they _clearly_ want to talk about books so I'm glad they are doing a book-club season!

# Absolute Batman (ongoing)

{{ image(path="whats-good-2024-12/absolute-batman.png", width=200, alt="Absolute Batman") }}

[Absolute Batman](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/2463692/absolute-batman-1) is an ongoing (as of December 2024) Batman series part of the [Absolute Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_Universe).
The other Absolute's do not quite click for me, but Absolute Batman is my jam.
Batman is poor and scrappy and Alfred is a bad-ass international spy dude and _it all rocks_.

The art is by [Nick Dragotta](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/people/876/nick-dragotta) who you would remember from [East of West](https://leagueofcomicgeeks.com/comic/8063885/east-of-west-1) -- and yes he can only draw one old man but that's OK because now that old man is Alfred and he looks like a BAMF.

# Sonic The Hedgehog 3

{{ image(path="whats-good-2024-12/sonic-3.png", width=200, alt="Sonic 3 The Hedgehog") }}

Sonic is the only movie series I actually go to the theater to watch.
Not Marvel, not Nolan's films like Oppenheimer, just Sonics 1, 2, and now 3.
So trust me when I say Sonic 3 is the best Sonic so far.

As always the film is nothing without Jim Carrey.
Don't get me wrong, I love Ben Schwartz but let's be real... this is the only Carrey-being-carrey movie we've gotten since uhh... Dumb and Dumber To?
Enjoy the gem (pun intended) that is Jim Carrey as Doctor Robotnik.
