This is the git repo for my blog.
Thanks for checkit it out!

## theme

First off, big thanks to [porterjamesj] on GitHub for letting me fork his theme for this blog.
I like the theme a lot.

## getting started

Are you using `nix`?
Perfect. You can just run `nix-shell`.

Now to run the dev server:

```
make devserver
```

For a regular build (not a live edit/rebuild loop/localhost server).

```
make build
```

## contributing

If you'd like to contribute by suggesting edits or even adding an article to the blog, make an issue or pull request.

Thanks!
