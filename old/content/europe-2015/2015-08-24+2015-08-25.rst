PDX -> AMS
----------

The flight was uneventful. It was the longest one I've ever been on, which is
always a rough milestone to overcome, but actually one of the better flights
I've taken. TIL Delta's service does not suck.

I usually sleep the entire way to <insert location here>, but I managed to stay
productive (coding, reading, writing) for the majority of flight. I must say,
it was nice to have my own personal screen to catch up on Last Week Tonight.
I've wanted to watch that show for ages...

[*Lazy bliss not pictured*]

So good.

Day 0: Part 1 
------------- 

So I wrote down some thoughts about Amsterdam thus far: 

* People keep using fake made up words. What's up with that? 
* The roads are tiny but people keep driving on them. It looks like chaos but I
  haven't seen an accident yet. I'm kinda impressed. People aren't even yelling
  at each other about almost getting hit. 
* The toilet paper squares are actually rectangles. It might just be the toilet
  paper at the place I am staying. Either way, I can't deal with this aspect
  ratio change. I might not be able to poop in Amsterdam. 
* **COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE COFFEE**
* The trains are so quiet. I didn't want to get off... 
* **BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES BIKES**

Here's some pictures I took:

Aaaaaaaand naptime. 

Day 0: Part 2 
------------- 

I finished today by going to the Red Light District. There 
were a lot of half naked ladies in windows. They kept winking 
at me. I'm pretty sure they liked me; it's not like they 
*definitely* have a monetary incentive to get my attention or 
anything.

I ended up finding a bar and enjoying a Belgian White Beer. 
It tasted `surprisingly good`_

*So this is what it feels like to drink in a bar... neat.*
