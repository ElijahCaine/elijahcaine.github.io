My Butt Hurts... 
---------------- 

Today I went on an awesome bike ride all the way to Haarlem (15km west of
Amsterdam). I didn't actually do anything there; I just went, picked up snacks,
and headed back. I'm 99% sure I missed out on an awesome Haarlem exclusive
cultural experience, but if was really more about the journey (I originally set
out to bike to the coast and Haarlem was my compromise to that).

    :alt: I don't recall where this park is exactly. I remember it was east of the city center, many kilometers.

*I found a very neat park near the Western edge of Amsterdam; I ended 
up spending an hour or so there having a picnic.* 

Dilapidated

*This was a cool abandoned building I found. I like abandoned 
buildings.*

*I also found this awesome trash can for people riding bikes. It's 
genius.*

*PONIES*

After the bike ride I was very tired. I slept a lot. And yet not enough... 

Small (and Large) Appreciations 
-------------------------------

Here is a list of some of the traits of Amsterdam (and what I have experienced
of the Netherlands at large) which I appreciate. 

* They have signs that tell you you're going the wrong direction. 
* You can bike to another city and be on bike paths the whole time! 
* Bikes are easy to use and aren't shoe-horned in as a second class mode of
  transportation. 
* The trains are so quiet. Why can't America have quiet trains? 

This list will probably grow as I remember things. All in all I like the city
and the country. You should visit if you haven't already.
