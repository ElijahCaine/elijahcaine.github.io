Play

For about 3 years I ran and mentored the Oregon State University Linux Users Group (`osulug`_).
We hosted

- *Industry Professionals* like CoreOS and Nordstrom engineers to speak with students about internships and
- *Student Talks* where club members gave talks on Raspberry Pi projects, software projects, Thesis Defense practice.
- *Install Festivals* where we helped people install Linux.
- *Coding Puzzles* where we are challenged to finish coding puzzles and rewarded for completing the most.
- *Game Hackathon* where we teamed up to complete a small working game in under an hour.
- *Languages Night* where we had a round-table to talk about software development.

The LUG stayed busy.
