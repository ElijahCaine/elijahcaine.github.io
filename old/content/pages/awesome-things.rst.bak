Below is a list of things which I find think are awesome, 2kool4skool, and
totally worth sharing.  The main purpose of this page is to make finding these
easier for me, but if you like it and think there's something else worth
sharing then you should `send it to me`_.  Think of it like a `Web 1.0
Portal`_.

Programming is a pretty broad topic, with a huge range of guides and helpful
information. Here's a list of resources I find to be especially useful.

`Why's Poignant guide to Ruby`_
-------------------------------

I'm not a particularly big fan of Ruby, but I do enjoy this guide. For
anybody looking for an introduction to programming at large or Ruby
specifically, this is a great place to start.

`Learn you a Haskell for Great Good`_
-------------------------------------

For something completely different, LyaHfGG is a great guide to Haskell as
well as Functional Programming. Not as goofy as Why's Poignant guide, but a
great introduction into a few new paradigms.

`Clojure for the Brave and True`_
---------------------------------

Just as the above guides, this book is very fun to read, accessible to a
large range of audiences, and is of course a great place to start learning with
Clojure.
