I taught myself `Blender 3D`_ when I was 12 and all through High School did small projects.
The above images and some of the videos in the following section are some of the things I made that I'm most proud of.

I've been an avid fan of film starting in elementary school.
The above is a collection of pretty much every movie I've made independently and in collaboration with friends.
