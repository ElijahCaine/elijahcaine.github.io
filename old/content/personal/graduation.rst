Today I checked my grades for the last time.
I can safely say that I have **finally** gotten a gorramn undergraduate degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Mathematics, from Oregon State University. [1]_ [3]_

I hear that this happens on the reg [2]_ but I'm sure that every single person who *actually graduates* feels amazing when they do.

It's not amazing because graduation is a Herculean feat.
I know I'm not a 60 year old grandmother who dreamt of getting a college degree for 45 years and finally scraped together the cash and time in retirement.
I'm also not a refugee that escaped a war-torn country for an education and a better life.
I'm just another white dude that checked all the boxes.

It wasn't hard for me.
I just had to put my head down and do the work.
But it did take a long ass time.

Honestly my story is exactly like *most* college graduation stories.
I went to kindergarten, then elementary school, then middle school, then high school, then college, and now life.
I plugged away at school, did what I needed to pass my classes, stressed and lamented, studied hard and eventually the system said "Cool. You're done."
Along the way I learned how to "play the game" [4]_, albeit a bit late compared to a lot of my peers.

I'm thankful to be in a field which doesn't require a masters or PHD to get a jorb.
Heck my field doesn't really require the degree I got; a surprising number of my friends got well paying jobs sans-degree.

I'm also thankful to graduate without debt.
This came from some kickass parents + grandparents, some work during school, and some bad stuff that happened which ended up paying for abou half of my tuition. 

I'm thankful to graduate with wonderful friends, a job, and some passions which make my work-related decisions simple and profitable.

Last, I'm thankful to be *done*.
Now I can finally focus on *learning*, my real passion.

I'm gonna have a `Cucumber Sour`_ and celebrate.
Thanks for reading.

.. [2] I'm 99% sure I graduated. Something horribly kafkaesque might still happen, but fuckit.

.. [4] This is shorthand for tips and tricks to get through school.

    School isn't really focused on making sure you *learned*, it's mostly designed to make sure you can pass tests.
    Once you figure this out you can focus on learning for the test instead of trying to grok the material.
    I believe the kids call it a "life hack".

    Not that you shouldn't try to grok the material, that just happens to take *way* longer than test-based learning.
    So if you want a personal life, learn for the test; if you want a PHD, learn for the material.

    I didn't figure this system out until about Junior year of High School, too late to apply this zen skill to the ACT and SAT, but it was useful in college.
