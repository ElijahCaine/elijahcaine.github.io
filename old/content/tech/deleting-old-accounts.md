I rate how easy it was to delete a bunch my compromised accounts

* Zynga doesn't even let me login on their website. 1/10

* Chegg does not let me delete my account or remove payment options. aparently have to call them. 3/10

* myfitnesspal: very easy to delete. 9/10

* Adobe: auto-password-reset, that's nice. 7/10 possible to delete my own account, but they tried to sell me shit on my way out the door. and it was just a request. dumb.

* tumblr was OK. 9/10

* myspace was also OK.  9/10

* disqus. 9/10 quick button click.

* didn't actually delete my kickstarter, but for what it's worth i couldn't find a button to do it... 3/10. Nevermind I found a link, 8/10. enabling 2FA was easy enough.

* Bitly did not require a password to delete my account. 9/10

* Dropbox: 9/10 pretty easy

* everymotion: had to email support. 3/10

* Ticketfly: cannot delete account need to contact support

I was able to self-remediate all but 6 of the initial 14 accounts.

Accounts where you can click "Sign Up/in with Google" but require a password to delete the account can go fuck themselves.

* Nobody got a 10/10 which is when the company goes out of business and wipes its servers for you.
