Say you have a firewall restriction that creates the following situation:

1. App1 cannot communicate directly with App2.
#. App1 and App2 can both talk to a Kubernets cluster.
#. Neither app is hosted on the Kubernetes cluster.
#. How can you get messages between App1 and App2?

The way the problem is stated makes it pretty obvious that the solution *involves* using a Kubernetes cluster, but how exactly?

The naive solution might be to spin up a container which acts as a proxy; Nginx comes to mind.
This would definitely work, but I am exceedingly lazy and don't want to learn how to configure Nginx.
In fact, the solution I came to doesn't involve running any new pods!

Here's the code.
Below I'll explain what's happening here and why it works.

.. code:: yaml

    kind: Endpoints
    metadata:
      name: myapp-proxy
    subsets:
    - addresses:
      - ip: 2.3.4.5k # App2's address
      ports:
      - port: 8080 # App2's service port
    apiVersion: v1

    ---

    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: myapp-proxy
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      loadBalancerSourceRanges:
      - "1.2.3.4/32" # App1's address
      ports:
      - protocol: TCP
        port: 80 # Redirect traffic hitting 80 to the app's service port
        targetPort: 8080
    apiVersion: v1

    ---

    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: restaurant-proxy
    spec:
    rules:
      - host: myapp-proxy.somehost.net
      http:
        paths:
        - path: /
            backend:
              serviceName: myapp-proxy
              servicePort: 80
    apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1

Endpoints
---------

Endpoints are the Kubernetes abstraction for IPs+Ports running the same application.
It's how you group together N instances of an app into one pool.

Under the hood Endpoints get created as a pre-requisite for every Service you deploy.
You don't usually need to deal with these directly as they are created implicitly whenever a Deployment gets applied.

By manually creating an endpoint we have imported our non-kubernetes app into Kubernetes.
That means we can do Kubernetes things with it like expose it via a Service or even put it behind an Ingress
Pretty neat!

Service
-------

Services are how we expose an endpoint to the world.
Most cloud providers will give you a public IP address for a service and load balance across all of that service's endpoints.

This is as far as we need to proxy traffic between our two Apps.
App1 makes a request to whatever IP Kubernetes gets for the `myapp-proxy` Service and relays it to the `myapp-proxy` endpoint, which ultimately routes the traffic to App2.
What's really cool is that the endpoint that **is** App2 can be an self-hosted Virtual Machine, as long as the IP doesn't change this proxy will continue to work.

Ingress
-------

Ingresses are my favorite part of Kubernetes.
They're very convenient, incredibly powerful, and they work like... over half the time.

While not strictly necessary, this Ingress gives us some nice-to-haves.

- Gives us an easy to manage host name via something like `External DNS`_.
- Could be extended to terminate SSL, again "for free", with something like `Cert Manager`_.

So that's how we use Kubernetes to manage services (lower-case 's') which aren't running in Pods.
