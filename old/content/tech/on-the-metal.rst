:summary: Let's learn computer graphics
:tags: math, cgi, graphics, 3d

Computing is a big field.
When I was getting my computer science degree I knew there were at least a dozen specialties I could go into.
All of these felt like entirely different worlds separated huge vallies of time needed to learn the basics all over again.

* Back-end web dev: Producing value for users with reasonably fast turnaround. Integrating with other systems.
* Crytography: Math and proofs; correctness is paramount.
* Front-end web dev: Platform quirks; browsers aren't all the same.
* Operations: Learning hundreds of tools and how they work together; maintaining complex systems.
* Networking dev: Gotta go fast; speed is paramount.
* Games dev: Do a bunch of complex stuff, 60-120 times per second. And make it fun.
* Mobile app dev: Front-end development with a heavier IDE.
* Graphics: Physics that needs to look pretty and be fast.
* Operating systems: Squeezing every bit out of the computer.

.. note::

    This is far from a complete list, and most of my assumptions about these fields, even the ones I have experience in, are nieve.
    The point is that these fields overlap in that they all uses computers, but differ wildly after scratching the surface.

This of course ignores the even wider world of computer engineering.
I don't even know enough about circuit boards and hardware to make a glib guess about it.

Developers and Programmers
--------------------------

    OK, that's cool but like what's your point?

I've been a back-end web developer and DevOpsâ„¢ engineer since before I graduated in 2017.
I'm very comfortable working at a high level of abstraction.
I treat computers as black boxes that magically turn my elegant algorithms into changing colors on a screen.

Sometimes I can spot performance bugs like this:

.. code:: python

    new_stuff = []
    for obj in some_queryset:
        new_thing = transform_thing(obj)
        new_stuff.append(new_thing)
    return new_stuff[0]

where I think "Hmm, that's going to be slow if ``some_queryset`` is like big".

I call working at this higher level of abstraction "developing".

Developer
    A devleoper turns compute into value, abstracted away the details of that compute.

This is in contrast with a _programmer_ who is focused on the physical computer.
A Programmer not only catches obvious bugs like calculating unecessary values, but asks "Is this program written for a computer".
Programmers think about cache hits and misses, context switches, byte allignment, and in squeezing computers for all their worth.

Programmer
    A programmer writes software with the computer it runs on in mind.

Growing up, and even after I started working full time, I considered these two words interchangable.
A programmer and a devleoper were basically the same title and you just used whichever was more appropriate.

I'm not a fan of splitting hairs between words, so what's my point?

Drawing a distinction between Developer and Programmer got me to think what I _currently_ do with computers, and what I _want_ to do with them next.

Getting close to the metal
--------------------------

I've been `dabbling with programming games`_ for a few months and it is... challenging.

I'm very familiar with the patterns of web development and I like working in that space.
It's lucritive, in relatively high demand, and I've gotten good at it.

Games on the other hand I don't have a ledge to hold on to.

I'm overwhelemed by graphics, the complex game engines, how hyper aware I need to be of performance.
It feels like I've spent _years_ learning about how to write software for computers and I opened a door and found an entirely different world.

Catching up to the point where I can make good games feels incredibly daunting, and I am _very_ excited.

How I learn
-----------

Here's how I learn something totally new:

* Ask the obvious question. "How do I program games?"
* This spawns more questions. "How do I program a graphics engine?"
* This spawns yet more questions. "What algorithms do I need for this?"
* Again and again... "What is a dot-product of two vectors?"
* Until I hit bedrock. "I have derived how dot-products work."
* Then the entire chain of questions get anwswered.

For the algorithmically minded, this is like a depth-first search.
I don't feel like I understand anything until I've asked and answered every question up the stack.

In practics I don't actually drill down this directly.
I usually do a bunch slower "breadth-first" search where I ask a lot of questions randomly until I hit bedrock and everything clicks.

This is very fulfilling in the end, I have a deep understanding of what I'm doing and I'm able to reason about what I'm doing at a few levels -- but it's incredibly slow and I give up before I get to the bottom of things.

Let's program games
-------------------

I'm really interested in making games, but I'm having a hard time picking up different engines.

* Unity and Unreal are power hogs and I don't have the patience to learn what all the buttons do.
* Amethyst and Bevy are good Rust frameworks, but I still haven't hit bedrock.

So becuase I'm very good at convincing myself of bad ideas, let's dig into how games work and learn the fundimentals.
Not becuase I want to write a game engine completely from scratch, I'm not Jonathan Blow.
Once I understand how higher level engines work I'll enjoy working with them, or I will have the power to fix them if I don't like them.

Graphics
~~~~~~~~

I picked "graphics" out of a hat so here's a bunch of resources I've been collecting about graphics programming:

* `PBRT`_
* `Scratchpixel`_ 
* `CS 450`_ Introduction to Computer Graphics
* `CS 457`_ Computer Graphics Shaders

Rust specific resources:

* `Learn GFX Hal`_
* `Learn WGPU`_
* `Writing a raytracer in Rust`_

General game stuff:

* `Game Programming Patterns`_
